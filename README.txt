How to deploy (split downloads)

1) Download index.html (separate link in chat) and save it on your computer.
2) Download pramaa_assets.zip and unzip it into a folder named 'assets' next to index.html.

Your folder structure should look like:
  /your-site-folder
    index.html
    /assets
      logo.png
      favicon.png

3) Drag-and-drop the whole folder to Netlify Drop (https://app.netlify.com/drop) OR upload to GoDaddy hosting (public_html).

Contact form:
- Replace EMAIL_HERE in index.html with your email (e.g., founder@pramaa.solutions) for FormSubmit.
- Or, on Netlify, enable Forms â†’ Notifications to receive submissions by email.
